By using static factory method, we can simplely create all variables by using AstFactory class. 
We do not need an instance of AstFactory class and we can create all type of variable through only one class.
This make us create the new expression or statement easier.
I used sinleton on Sequence class, this make the program only can create one instance for Sequence.
Because Sequence is the final result we want to see, so we only need one.
This will save space, because when we create a new Sequence, we will not create a new instance, we just change the old one which will save the space.
